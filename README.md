Here is a report of the problems that we faced while working on the first robo-car and the solutions that we used to improve it.

In the beginning, we started addressing the issues in the first robo-car. The first issue was the very unstable design. There was not much material to work with. Also, there was uncalculable movement which was due to lack of sensors and poor design decisions. The last issue was the poor use of sensors. They can't read color accurately due to lack of testing.

According to these issues, we started to use some solutions for improvement. First, we ditched the old design and tried to make a whole new one from the beginning. Actually, we tried to make a fully 3D printed robo-car, but due to lack of time, we couldn't. As a result, we decided that it would better for us to buy a simple car and make changes on it. Therefore, we bought the car and started working on it. Fortunately, we made a car that has enough stable design, and this solved the uncalculable movement. Finally, we solved the sensors issue by adding support sensors (ultrasonic) so that the robo-car can correct itself when it is too close to a wall.
