first, we started with addressing the issues seen in the first robo-car, and they are:
	- very unstable design (not much meterial to work with)
	- uncalculable movement (due to lack of sensors and poor design decisions)
	- poor use of sensors (can't read color accurately due to lack of testing)


first thing first, we addressed the design, we ditched the old design and tried to make a whole new one from scratch, we tried to make a fully 3d printed robo-car, but due to lack of time we decided that it's best for us to buy a simple car and build on it, so we bought a car and got to work, then we made a car that has stable enough design, this also solves uncalculable movement.


then we addressed the sensors issue by adding support sensors (ultrasonic) so that the robo-car can correct it self if to close to a wall.
